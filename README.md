# Terraform GKE Kubeconfig

üìù Terraform module that generates a Kubeconfig for accessing GKE clusters

## Motivations

When provisioning GKE clusters, there is no direct (API) way to obtain a 
kubeconfig, and the only way _to_ do so requires a hard external dependency on 
the [gcloud cli](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/get-credentials), 
and by extension, a working python installation.

Additionally, `gcloud` provides no means of obtaining a kubeconfig that uses 
[certificate](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#x509-client-certs)
or [password](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#static-password-file) 
authentication.

This module streamlines this process by generating a kubeconfig file similar to
how `gcloud` would, without needing it as a dependency. This config can then be 
passed to other units (`kubectl`, `helm`, etc) for usage.

## Usage

To use this module, a pre-built [release][github-release-link] version can be sourced.

```hcl
module "kubeconfig" {
  source = "https://github.com/joshdk/terraform-gke-kubeconfig/releases/download/0.1.0/module.tgz"
  ...
}
```

Alternatively, a development version can be sourced instead.

```hcl
module "kubeconfig" {
  source = "github.com/joshdk/terraform-gke-kubeconfig//module"
  ...
}
```

To configure inputs for the module, refer to the bundled [readme](https://github.com/joshdk/terraform-gke-kubeconfig/blob/master/module/README.md).
